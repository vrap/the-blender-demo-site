    <p>The Blender is an automatic and connected cocktail dispenser, which was created with the following principles:<br />

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a></li>
        <li>modularity</li>
        <li>lowcost</li>
    </ul>

    This cocktail dispenser is a project of four students from the <a href="http://www.u-cergy.fr/fr/index.html">University of Cergy-Pontoise</a> (France), in the formation <a href="http://www.lp-dw.com/">licence professionnelle d√©veloppeur & Web mobile</a>. It is realized in the context of specialization course about connected objects and Internet of things.<br /><br />

    As mentionned above, the project was designed to be open-source, and let you:

    <ul>
        <li>To clone The Blender with help of some tools, as lasercutter, 3D printer and some electronic materials.</li>
        <li>To fork The Blender, and improve it or propose new feature for others users.</li>
        <li>To create or join a community of cocktails lover and share your creations with your friends.</li>
        <li>To expand your Blender with new module.</li>
    </ul>

    The simplicity aspect of the project has been in our mind throughout the duration of the project and you can found some informations about:

    <ul>
        <li>materials requirements</li>
        <li>hardware plans</li>
        <li>software explanations</li>
        <li>a lot more stuff that we think it's necessary for you</li>
    </ul>
