Next version: v1.0 _stable_

### Overview

Four computer science students had the idea of creating The Blender. This machine is a connected cocktails dispenser, linked to an application for creating recipes.

The Blender is a succession of structures called modules, each containing a valve and a bottle.  
One such module is called Master, it contains no valve or bottle, but the electronics required for the machine.  
A robot which is placed on a glass moves under these modules and recovered doses of liquid to makes cocktails.

A smartphone [application](#/doc/en/application) is needed to control The Blender.

A [community](#/doc/en/community) system lets users share their favorite cocktails.
> __Note:__ a web application is also available

The creative process is trying to respect these 3 principles:
* opensource : everyone can recover the plans of the machine and [softwares](https://github.com/vrap/) parts and modify them.
* modularity : in theory, it may be a very large number of modules, and therefore a very high number of cocktails available. 
* lowcost : the materials used are easy to find, and especially cheap.

* * *

### Getting started

The following documentation is created to allow you to build your own modules and assemble The Blender.

We tried to make these as clear as possible, but the principles, techniques and technologies used are not necessarily simple. If you find that the documentation can be improved, please let us know.  

> __Note:__ throughout the documentation, small parts (e.g cables or electric power) are not on the list of supplies needed.

* * *

### Now you can:

* install the [application](#/doc/en/application)
* create a [community](#/doc/en/community)
* build your own [Blender](#/doc/en/blender) machine

> __Note:__ despite the simplicity of The Blender, it is nevertheless necessary to have a minimum of computer and electronic knowledge to correctly use the various elements.

Enjoy!
