## The blender

The blender structure created for a easy assembling. This documentation explaine you how you can cut, print, glue, assembling a complete blender machine.

> __Caution__, machines to cut and 3D print as necessary  
(you can find there, on structure like [fabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/))

* A _laser cut machine_ (to cut all blender structure)
* A _3d print machine_ (to print the mecanique)

The Blender have got 3 principals parts to make cocktail.

* A master
* A robot
* A module 

* * *

### The master

#### Needed

* A module master (See the documentation of [module](#/doc/en/module/) to make it)
* An Arduino uno
* A motor shield
* A Rasbery

#### Electronique connection

// need schema electrique

To install the soft on the arduino, see the [application doc](#/doc/en/application)
