## The Blender

The Blender structure is designed to allow easy assembling. The following documentation provides details of cutting, gluing and assembly the various components of the machine.

> __Caution__, machines used to cut and 3D print as necessary 
(they can be found in structures such as [FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/)).

The Blender is composed of 3 major elements:

* One Master
* Several modules
* One robot

* * *

### Master

#### Needed

* A module master (See the documentation of [module](#/doc/en/module/) to make it)
* An Arduino UNO
* A motor shield
* A Rasbperry

#### Electronic connection

// Need electric schema

To install the soft on the Arduino, see the [Application](#/doc/en/application)

#### Server application

After you have a ready arduino, connect your rasberry with the usb. You can put it on the last floor of your module master.

To install the software on your Raspberry, see the [Application](#/doc/en/application)

* * *

### Module (pourer)

#### Needed

* A module (see the documentation [here](#/doc/en/module/))
* A valve (to print, download the file [here]())
* A pipe (buying [here]())
* A bottle of _HÃ©par_ (a french trend mark very famouse)

* * *

### Robot

#### Needed

* A robot structure (See the documentation [here](#/doc/en/robot/))
* The mecaniques (to print, download the file [here]())
* A steper
* A Sensor

#### Electronic connection

// Need electronic schema 

> __Caution__, in this version of the blender, you have to connect your robot in master with cable. This is necessary to provide a large power cable lenght proportional of your total of module.
