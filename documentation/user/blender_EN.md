## The Blender

The Blender structure is designed to allow easy assembling. The following documentation provides details of cutting, gluing and assembly the various components of the machine.

> __Caution__, machines used to cut and 3D print as necessary 
(they can be found in structures such as [FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/)).

The Blender is composed of 3 major elements:

* One Master
* Several modules
* One robot

* * *

### Master

The Master module is not expected to have a bottle and a valve, it contains electronics (Arduino, cables and Raspberry Pi).

#### Equipment

* A Master structure (see the [documentation](#/doc/en/module/))
* An [Arduino UNO](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno)
* A [Motor Shield](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3)
* A [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)

#### Electronic connection

// Need electric schema

To install the software part on the Arduino, see the [documentation](#/doc/en/application)

#### Server application

After you have a ready Arduino, connect your Raspberry Pi with a USB port. You can put it on the last floor of your module master.

To install the software on your Raspberry Pi, see the [Application](#/doc/en/application)

* * *

### Module

This is the base module, which contains a valve and a bottle.

#### Equipment

* A module structure (see the [documentation](#/doc/en/module/))
* A valve (to print, download the file [here]())
* A pipe (buying [here]())
* A bottle of _HÃ©par_ (a french trend mark very famouse)

* * *

### Robot

#### Equipment

* A robot structure (see the [documentation](#/doc/en/robot/))
* The mecanics (to print, download the file [here]())
* A stepper motor
* A sensor

#### Electronic connection

// Need electronic schema 

> __Caution__, in this version of the blender, you have to connect your robot in master with cable. This is necessary to provide a large power cable lenght proportional of your total of module.
